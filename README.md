# PythonBeginnerProjects

This repository contains many of the basic projects with Python.

## bankingSystem

This project was completed to help understand parent and child classes better.

## footballMadlib

This project was a very basic project completed to learn about user input, variables, and f-strings. It's a fun twist on the traditional madlib in order to generate a football transfer rumor.

## guessNumberGame

This project was used to showcase the random library. It utilizes some of the basic principles of Python, showcasing a while loop and if statements.

## hangman

This project was created to replicate the game hangman. It uses the random library and the string library to allow the user to play the game. Although not added to this repo, there is a file referenced (from words import words) which contains a list of possible words that can be used in the game.

## medicalNoteTemplate

This project was very similar to the footballMadlib project, but modified to match a real world use case - to help a medical provider write a patient note.
